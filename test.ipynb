      "Post: AITAH for banning users with scam links and other domains mostly bots use? Hello AITAH community!\n",
      "\n",
      "Since our head mod began recruiting efforts a few months ago, we've expanded our moderation team and increased our toolkit to try to give you the best experience this sub can offer. Our last mod announcement was unfortunately on April 1st but we assure you our efforts are not a joke. We care about this community and want to see the quality in this community continue to improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few changes we've implemented over the last few months since the new team came on:\n",
      "\n",
      "Automod: We actually use it now! We're banning social media links, scam links, amazon links, anything that can be used to monetize or self-promote has been banned. We also try to filter out those oh-so-real posts about making it big on gambling sites and we continually adjust the filter on hot topics. Nobody needs rage bait, right? Additionally we get warnings if a post or comment gets too many reports. Reports are important, this will be a theme in the post.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rules: Rules have been refined and expounded upon. You may have noticed some comments removed for name calling or incivility. Reports from users really help us find these (theme). We have put the rules in the sidebar, the new.reddit sidebar, and the wiki. No matter how you reddit, the new rules are there, you should see them and maybe take a moment to review them. If we were to undergo anything more drastic than common sense rule changes, we will announce them in a post and sticky it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've also added automated tools against ban evasion, bots, karma farmers, and scammers. None of these are perfect, obviously, but they have managed to catch some of the repeat trolls, lower-quality bots, and most of the \"AITAH for looking too hot in my bikini? link to my OF here btw\" posts. If you get caught in one of these, the initial modmail should contain instructions on how to reverse it, otherwise reach out and we will investigate.\n",
      "\n",
      "A specific note about one of these tools: it checks links in your profile and your activity on specific karma-farming subreddits. We do not police regular subreddit usage, you will never see us ban you for posting in \"normal\" subreddits such as sports, your city subreddit, or even political subs. We only ban participants in karma farming or scammer-oriented subs. We also don't ban normal social links - your FB, Insta, etc. are all fine. We ban links where people could give you money - both SFW ones like Venmo and CashApp and NSFW ones. If you need these links in your profile, you can make an alt account without the links, and we will ignore Reddit's ban evasion warnings if you let us know. We can't sort out the real enterprising users who frequent this sub from those that are owners of hundreds of bots, and we won't attempt the effort or the botfarm owners would just appeal the bans. We are not anti-sex worker or anti-entrepreneur, we are anti bots. Blame the bots or yell at us and take a perma.\n",
      "\n",
      "Report alerts (theme): We get bat-signals for reports now. Please, please use reports appropriately and not as a super-downvote. If a comment or post gets enough reports, we at least lay eyes on them and discuss internally. We have modmail, we have a chat group. We don't only look at reported posts, but reporting them makes them much more visible to us. We've seen the shittiest ragebait barely garner 3 reports on something with 2k karma, and there will be 50 comments calling it fake. We need your reports, we use them. Please report responsibly and we'll do our part, we know mods have been less responsive in the past but our mod team has grown and so has our response team. Please report personal attacks and AI slop, we hate both. A note on the custom report feature - this can be helpful to note previous posts by OP, or a link to an old post they obviously copied from, but sometimes it is less helpful. We can mute reports from someone if they make unhelpful custom reports, and if that happens too often we will disable that feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "These automations come with collateral damage. We get people who got hacked and had those links put in their profile. We get software devs who just leave an open hand asking for a coffee if you appreciate their efforts. We get people who mostly post in local city subs looking to pawn off their wares. We get bots. Like a lot of bots. Like holy shit a lot of them. The ban to complaint ratio is still very good but every morning the moderation team wakes up to appeals because xXSweetCherryXx, an account made 19 hours ago, can't post here any more because \"she\" has links to OF, paypal, and/or fansly (this is not a comprehensive example, it's a lot more) on her profile. If we didn't ban them then, they'd be banned in a dozen days after making some AI shitpost and then shitting up other subs spamming their AI onlyfans content.\n",
      "\n",
      "We put these restrictions in place to allow the most common contributor to the sub to persist. The \"This is a throwaway, here is my real story\" user. We can put in account age limits, but the bots use abandoned reddit profiles, the bot owners are also patient. We can put in karma requirements, but the bots karma farm in karma farm subs or no-karma-required subs. We cannot impose limitations that do not adversely affect the real contributions to this subreddit. So instead we added the automated tools. It's the best solution we have now while leaving the door open to genuine throwaways. If the community is so sick of the fake posts that you want us to try these anyway, please let us know and we will try to implement this in a way that minimizes the collateral to real throwaways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our final say is the tools do more good than harm, much to the dismay of our more entrepreneurial posters who are real people. We have actually been repeatedly asked by mods of other major subreddits to implement some of these tools, since they notice the shitposters build up their karma minimums here. It is the mod team's opinion that this policy is a largely net good, but we want to remain transparent as we implement broader changes to the sub.\n",
      "\n",
      "So reddit, AITAH for adding apps to block scam links, auto-hide comments with a ton of reports, and block users who have links that are commonly associated with scams? NTA. Thanks for what you do. All very reasonable. Thanks for looking out for the community.  NTA I'm seeing a big problem where someone says something true but unpopular, and then the people who didn't like the thing being said mass report the comment until the auto mod bans the person.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We even have a reminder to not downvote assholes, yet it still happens and the mass reporting is just a continuation of that.  I have no solutions besides turning off the auto-ban for mass reports, but you should consider this problem more deeply. NTA\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel free to ban more people.  So many ChatGPT posts here lately.  Ban them, with a hammer.\n",
      "\n",

      "Post: AITA for silently changing my son's name after my brother and SIL gave my nephew the name too? My wife and I had our son 4 months ago. We had a name chosen early in her pregnancy. We kept that name to ourselves but my SIL (married to my brother) found it out when she was still pregnant with my nephew (almost 7 months old). She never said how. She just told us she loved the name, congrats and she couldn't wait to meet him. We assume she snooped because she was not told. I even mentioned it to my brother and he said that his wife does like to browse through people's things like it was no biggie. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then when my nephew was born they announced his name and it was the name we chose. First, middle and last name. My brother called right after SIL posted the announcement and he told me to keep quiet because his wife had a rough birth and she didn't need drama and he knew we might not like it but she really wanted the name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her reason? My brother and I have matching twin-like names and SIL wanted to connect our two boys by just giving them the same name so they were each other's namesake.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I talked it over and we decided to pick a different name. But we'd pretend to keep the original name until there was zero risk of SIL changing my nephew's name (6 months after a birth is harder to make a change in our state).\n",
      "\n",
      "We only started telling people the true name last week. My parents and sisters said it made sense. Friends and my ILs understood why we did it. My brother told me I upset his wife by silently doing this shit and taking away her choice to match the boys. He told me it was a dick move. I told him his wife using the full name we chose was a dick move.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked him if he considered how much tougher it would be with both boys enrolled in the same schools with the very same name. Not to mention banking, doctors, dental all kinds of stuff. He told me plenty of people have the same name and it's not a big deal and it's harder to mix shit up now and we're just trying to gatekeep names.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think he's cray. So does my wife. She said he clearly doesn't want SIL to be mad. But AITA for what I did? Like are we weird for thinking of this kind of stuff? Definitely NTA: Your brother is outraged that you \"took away SIL's choice to match the boys\" What about the fact that she took away your choice to have an individual name?  By invading your privacy? He's fine with that I assume? But you didn't 'gatekeep'. You didn't tell them they had to change the name they stole from you. You were quite kind and didn't make a fuss over it.  \n",
      "They are mentally deficient. Congrats on your new baby ♥ NTA for not letting SIL dictate names, her snooping was low-key whack. Your boy deserves an identity that's uniquely his, sans familial name-cloning drama. Normally I would say that you don't own the name, but the issue here is with SIL's deciding on her own \"to match the boys\".  That's just weird.  NTA. NTA, and honestly? You’re kind of a legend. Your SIL straight up stole the name from your unborn child like it was a baby naming Black Friday sale. First, middle, and last? That’s not “connecting the cousins,” that’s identity theft with extra audacity. And your brother’s like, “Please don’t cause drama, she just gave birth.” Sir, your wife created drama.. You handled it perfectly: strategic silence, tactical rename, and a plot twist reveal once the name-change window closed. That’s Game of Thrones-level parenting. Also, let’s be real your brother saying “plenty of people have the same name” is hilarious when they deliberately stole yours. That’s not coincidence, that’s copy pasting.\n",

He was always cold, made snide comments, and treated me like I was in the way. I told my mom how uncomfortable I felt, but she always defended him and told me I was exaggerating. Eventually, she stopped picking me up from school if it interfered with his plans. I spent a lot of nights at my aunt’s house just to avoid being home.\n",

You have overcome an abusive childhood. Good for you. Tell her you know she was doing her best, and that's the problem.  If you thought she would be able to do better in the future, you might be open to reconciling.  But you believe her- that truly was her best, and it wasn't nearly good enough, so there's no point in going forward with a relationship.  NTA. NTA - Idk how old you are but have you seen a 12-year-old recently? Look at a 12-year-old and can you genuinely imagine abandoning them? The problem was never her partner, it was her. She never put any measures in place to protect you, she never listened to you when you tried to talk to her, and she left you when you looked up to her the most. \n",

      "The actual audacity for her to act like you're being cold is crazy because nothing you've said or done is as cold as what she did.

      "Post: AITAH for kicking my mom out of my graduation dinner after she brought her husband instead of my dad? I (22F) graduated from college last weekend. My parents divorced when I was 15, and while they’re civil, they’re not friendly. My mom remarried a year after the divorce to the guy she cheated on my dad with, so it’s still a sore subject in our family.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told both parents about my dinner reservation after graduation and made it clear: I wanted BOTH of my parents there, just them. No stepparents. I even said, “It’s one night for the two people who raised me.” My dad understood immediately. My mom nodded, but didn’t say much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graduation day comes. I walk out of the ceremony and see my dad… and my mom with her husband (the affair guy). I immediately pulled her aside and reminded her of what I asked. She just said, “It’s my husband. I’m not excluding him from a family event.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I told her if she couldn’t respect my one request, she couldn’t come to dinner. She tried to guilt me. said he drove her, said they already booked a hotel but I stood firm. She left crying. My dad was quiet the whole time, and dinner ended up awkward and tense. Now my mom is telling family I humiliated her on my day. Some people think I overreacted and that I should’ve just \"dealt with it for one night.”\n",

      "I also read that you never said that the ceremony was just for your parents too. So that ceremony was never part of the request since you never specified it. But dinner? Nah.

      "\n",
      "My mom is also married to her AP and I plan to make the same request for my wedding. Your dad deserves to enjoy watching HIS daughter graduate without feeling uncomfortable and being reminded that your mom is a selfish wench. It’s easy for extended family to say, you overreacted, when they weren’t the ones watching their mom rebuild life with the man who blew up the family.
